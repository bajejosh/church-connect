That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,

''Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

''Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

He will my Shield and Portion be,
As long as life endures.',

for a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I''ll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.

[Verse 2]
O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
has a wondrous attraction for me;
for the dear Lamb of God left his glory above
to bear it to dark Calvary.

[Verse 3]
In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
a wondrous beauty I see,
for ''twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
to pardon and sanctify me.

[Verse 4]
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
its shame and reproach gladly bear;
then he''ll call me some day to my home far away,
where his glory forever I''ll share.',

Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.',

When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in,
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!',

Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount, I''m fixed upon it,
Mount of Thy redeeming love.

Here I raise my Ebenezer;
Here by Thy great help I''ve come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I''m constrained to be!
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here''s my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above.',

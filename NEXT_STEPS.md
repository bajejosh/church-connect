# Church Connect - Next Steps

## Important Notice
**Current Error:** If you're seeing `PGRST204: Could not find the 'cover_position' column` error, you need to run the database migrations!

Follow these steps:
1. Apply the `20250408_add_image_positioning.sql` migration to your Supabase instance
2. Either use the Supabase CLI: `npx supabase db push`
3. Or run the SQL directly in the Supabase SQL editor

See the migration README for more details.

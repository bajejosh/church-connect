## Technical Improvements Needed
1. Complete database migrations for all new tables and relationships
2. Implement proper error handling throughout the application
3. Add comprehensive data validation
4. Create unit and integration tests
5. Optimize bundle size with code splitting
6. Improve accessibility standards compliance
7. Review and refactor CSS to prevent circular dependencies
   - Fixed circular dependency between `.dark .text-gray-500` and `.dark .text-gray-400` classes

## Immediate Next Steps
For our next development session, we should focus on:

1. **Apply Database Migrations** - HIGHEST PRIORITY - Execute the migration to add is_anonymous column to posts table
2. **Profile Page Redesign** - HIGH PRIORITY
3. **Enhanced Media Support** - HIGH PRIORITY - Replace Suno iframe embeds with direct links
4. **Prayer Groups Functionality**
5. **Performance Optimizations**
6. **Unit Testing Implementation**
7. **CSS Refactoring & Style Improvements** - Analyze the styling system for any other potential circular dependencies
8. **TailwindCSS Organization** - Consider splitting dark mode overrides into a separate file for better maintainability

## Database Recommendations

For optimal functionality, consider the following database modifications:

1. **Posts Table Update**: (Created migration file: 20250408_add_posts_is_anonymous.sql)
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE posts 
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_anonymous BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS categories TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}';
   ```

2. **Theme Preferences Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_preferences (
     id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
     theme VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'dark',
     accent_color VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'blue',
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

3. **Prayer Groups Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS prayer_groups (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     name TEXT NOT NULL,
     description TEXT,
     church_id UUID REFERENCES churches(id),
     created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS prayer_group_members (
     group_id UUID REFERENCES prayer_groups(id),
     user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
     role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'member',
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
     PRIMARY KEY (group_id, user_id)
   );
   ```

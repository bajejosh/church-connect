# Church Connect - Claude Knowledge Base

This directory contains the knowledge base files for use with Claude to assist in the development of the Church Connect application.

## Purpose

The Claude knowledge base provides comprehensive documentation about the Church Connect application architecture, components, features, and development practices. This enables Claude to:

1. Answer questions about the application's structure and design
2. Assist with coding tasks and troubleshooting
3. Provide consistent guidance based on project standards
4. Help new developers onboard quickly

## Knowledge Base Structure

The knowledge base is organized into focused documentation files:

- **APPLICATION_OVERVIEW.md** - High-level description of the Church Connect app
- **AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM.md** - Documentation of the authentication system
- **DATABASE_SCHEMA.md** - Detailed database schema documentation
- **TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Comprehensive technical architecture overview
- **FRONTEND_COMPONENT_GUIDE.md** - Documentation of the component structure and patterns
- **FEATURE_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Detailed descriptions of the main features
- **API_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Information about API endpoints and usage
- **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md** - Development standards and best practices
- **WORKFLOWS.md** - Common user workflows and interaction patterns
- **NEXT_STEPS.md** - Current status and upcoming development priorities

## How to Use with Claude

When working with Claude on the Church Connect project, you can:

1. **Reference specific files**: "Based on the TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md file, how should I structure the church creation component?"

2. **Ask for guidance**: "What's the recommended way to implement form validation in Church Connect?"

3. **Request code assistance**: "Can you help me write a React component for the prayer request list based on the documentation?"

4. **Seek clarification**: "I'm confused about the relationship between churches and users. Can you explain how this works?"

## Maintaining the Knowledge Base

As the project evolves, keep this knowledge base updated:

1. **Add new documentation** for new features or components
2. **Update existing files** when implementations change
3. **Expand sections** that need more detail based on common questions
4. **Create new reference files** for specialized topics as needed

## Using Claude for Development

Claude is particularly helpful for:

1. **Code generation** - Creating components, hooks, utilities, etc.
2. **Troubleshooting** - Diagnosing and fixing issues
3. **Architecture discussions** - Exploring design options
4. **Learning** - Understanding project patterns and practices
5. **Documentation** - Creating or improving documentation

## Best Practices for Claude Prompts

For optimal assistance:

1. **Be specific** about what you're asking
2. **Provide context** about the problem or task
3. **Reference relevant documentation** from the knowledge base
4. **Clarify constraints** or requirements
5. **Build on previous conversations** for continuity

## Example Prompts

Good examples of prompts to use with Claude:

- "Using the component patterns in FRONTEND_COMPONENT_GUIDE.md, help me create a ChurchCard component to display church information."

- "I'm implementing the church creation workflow described in WORKFLOWS.md. Can you help me write the React component for the church creation form?"

- "Based on the API_DOCUMENTATION.md, how should I implement the function to fetch a user's church data?"

- "I'm getting an error when trying to create a new prayer request. Based on the database schema, what might be causing this?"

- "Walk me through how to implement the calendar view component following the guidelines in DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md."

By leveraging this knowledge base effectively, Claude can provide highly relevant assistance throughout the development of the Church Connect application.

```

## 5. Crafting Effective Prompts

To get the most out of your Claude assistant, craft effective prompts that:

1. **Provide context**: Tell Claude what aspect of the Church Connect app you're asking about
2. **Be specific**: Ask clear, focused questions
3. **Indicate format**: Specify how you want the answer formatted (code, explanations, step-by-step, etc.)
4. **Set boundaries**: Clarify if you want brief overviews or detailed explanations

### Example Prompts

**Development Assistance:**
```
Based on the Church Connect documentation, help me implement a function to filter events by date range using the Supabase client. Show me the code and explain how it works.
```

**Architecture Understanding:**
```
Explain how the authentication flow works in Church Connect, from the user clicking "login" to being fully authenticated with a valid session.
```

**Troubleshooting:**
```
I'm getting a "Permission denied" error when trying to create a new event. Based on the knowledge base, what might be causing this and how can I fix it?
```

## 6. Testing and Refining Your Project

After setting up your Claude Project, test it thoroughly:

1. **Ask varied questions** covering different aspects of the Church Connect app
2. **Note gaps in knowledge** or areas where Claude's responses could improve
3. **Add missing information** to your knowledge base
4. **Refine document structure** if Claude struggles to find relevant information
5. **Update regularly** as the application evolves

## 7. Use Cases for Your Claude Assistant

Your Claude Project can serve multiple roles:

### For Developers
- Code assistance
- Architecture guidance
- Debugging help
- Documentation generation

### For Project Managers
- Feature status tracking
- Understanding technical dependencies
- Planning guidance

### For End Users
- Usage tutorials

## 8. Example Knowledge Base File

Here's an example of what a knowledge base file for the Church Connect calendar feature might look like:

```markdown
# Church Connect - Calendar Feature

## Overview
The Calendar feature in Church Connect allows churches to create, manage, and view events such as services, worship practices, and meetings. It supports monthly, quarterly, and yearly views.

## User Features
- Create and edit events
- View events in different time scales (month, quarter, year)
- Filter events by type (service, practice, meeting)
- Associate worship teams with events
- Select songs for worship events

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `Calendar.jsx`: Main calendar view component
- `EventForm.jsx`: Form for creating/editing events
- `EventDetail.jsx`: Detailed view of an event
- `SongSelection.jsx`: Interface for selecting songs for events

### Database Tables
- `events`: Stores event information
- `event_songs`: Junction table connecting events to songs

### State Management
The calendar uses React Query for data fetching with the following key queries:
- `useEvents`: Fetches events based on date range and filters
- `useEventDetails`: Fetches detailed information for a specific event

### Code Example - Fetching Events
```javascript
const fetchEvents = async (dateRange) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('events')
    .select('*')
    .gte('start_time', dateRange.start)
    .lte('start_time', dateRange.end);
    
  if (error) throw error;
  return data;
};
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Performance with Many Events
For churches with many events, the calendar can become slow. Solutions:
- Implement pagination
- Optimize Supabase queries with indexes
- Use virtualization for rendering many events

### Date Handling Bugs
Time zone issues can cause events to appear on wrong days:
- Store all dates in UTC
- Convert to local time only for display
- Use dayjs consistently for all date operations

## Related Features
- Worship Team Management: Teams are assigned to events
- Songs Library: Songs are selected for worship events
- User Permissions: Controls who can create and edit events
```

## Additional Knowledge Base Resources

### Knowledge Base File Formats

Claude works best with these file formats:
- Markdown (.md) - Preferred for structured documentation
- Text (.txt) - Simple format for basic information
- PDF - For more complex formatted documents
- HTML - For web-based documentation

### Best Practices for Knowledge Base Maintenance

1. **Version Control**: Store knowledge base files in your GitHub repository alongside code
2. **Update Regularly**: Update documentation when code changes
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent structure across documents
4. **Metadata**: Include metadata like creation date, version, and author
5. **Cross-References**: Use consistent naming and cross-reference between documents

## Implementing Claude in Your Development Workflow
